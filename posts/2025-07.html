    My goal is to turn this bare-bones website into a personal blog!
    Social media has been incredibly damaging to my psyche, to say the least.
    All I've ever wanted was a semi-public place where I could express myself and 
    use as a little archive to satisfy my irrational and extreme need for control and organization.
    And maybe also get better at talking/writing about myself instead of just holding everything in 
    and keeping my mouth shut. I've always been good at academic writing because there's a really clear 
    frame to follow, but when it comes to everything else, it's almost as if I'm mute. It's something I 
    feel very insecure about, especially since my grammar just goes out the window when I start yapping like this.
    </p>

    <p>
    It's also just hard to talk about yourself when you feel so anxious all the time, and there are a 
    million vague, abstract, vibey thoughts and feelings floating in your brain that you have to somehow 
    collapse into a single coherent sentence.
    </p>
    <p><b>"How are you?? How have you been??"</b></p>
    <p>I don't know!!! I feel a million different things and I don't have the words to describe them.</p>

    <p>Anyway!!</p>
    <p>
    I don't really know web design, but I do know how to code, so I'm hoping to pick it up pretty quickly along the way.
