            <h1>This site is under construction ^_^</h1>
            <p><b>Welcome to my home on the web!</b></p>
            <p>
                I built this website to document everything I love. I’ve come to realize, in these past few years, 
                how detrimental social media is to my psyche and creativity - and how making my own website, having 
                control over every tiny detail of how it's represented (and how I'm represented by extension), is 
                actually a perfect solution to all of my problems, including my irrational need for documentation 
                and organization across many parts of my life.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>I made this site for me, and me only!</b> 
                But I do hope you have a good time here ♡ 
                Please feel free to reach out and write in my <a href="guestbook.html">guestbook</a>!
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>This site is probably not phone-compatible right now.</b>
                I plan to make that happen in the future, but I’m still new to front-end.
