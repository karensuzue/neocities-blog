                <p>
                    I built this website to document everything I love. I’ve come to realize, in these past few years, 
                    how detrimental social media is to my psyche and creativity - and how making my own website, having 
                    control over every tiny detail of how it's represented (and how I'm represented by extension), is 
                    actually a perfect solution to all of my problems, including my irrational need for documentation 
                    and organization across many parts of my life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>I made this site for me, and me only!</b> 
                    But I do hope you have a good time here ♡ 
                    Please feel free to reach out and write in my <a href="guestbook.html">guestbook</a>!

                <p>
                    <b>This site is probably not phone-compatible right now.</b>
                    I plan to make that happen in the future, but I’m still new to front-end.
