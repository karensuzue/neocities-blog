        <p>
        This is my first attempt at knitting a sweater. I am learning a lot about knitting in the round,
        shaping, and top-down construction along the way! 
        </p>

            <b>November 28, 2025</b><br>
            Didn't bother gauge swatching... knitting an XS <br>
            First time doing increases and short rows! And knitting in the round (using a mix of magic and traveling loop) <br>
            I'm using Knit Picks Palette held double - I believe this turns the yarn into worsted weight, 
            based on the article from 
            <a href="https://www.susannawinter.net/post/2019/12/20/math-for-knitters-knitting-with-yarn-held-double">susannawinter.net</a> 
            <br>
            Frogged/restarted this 5 times :')

            Finished neckline and shoulders! 
            Watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D49f490un-U">Clo Knit's tutorial</a> 
            and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7IV83NtHTQ">elephaby's knit with me video</a> for troubleshooting

            I messed up the increases around the top part of one of the sleeves :/ 
            I don't think it's noticeable so I'll keep going. 
            I feel like with wear the fabric is going to felt anyway, so it’s fine. <br>
            There’s also a small hole at the center of the collar - 
            it’s virtually unnoticeable so I’ll ignore it. 
            As long as the sweater fits me right idc

            <b>December 14, 2025</b><br>
            Sleeves and body are now split! <br>
            The left sleeve has 1 extra stitch :/ I might do a decrease there or an increase on the right sleeve. Idk.<br>
            I'm planning to add waist shaping soon <br>
            Overall not bad for my first sweater/third knitting project!! I’m so excited to finish the body

            Waist shaping plan 
            (stolen from <a href="https://www.andrearangel.com/andrearangelblog/dissent-mods-adding-waist-shaping">this article</a>, 
            also cross referencing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx1VbTvIeFx_vatKLrILZN7PQvwiRbCWq">Simply in Stitches' tutorials</a>):<br>
            <i>Work to 3 stitches before an underarm marker, k2tog, knit 1, slip marker, 
            knit 1, ssk, repeat for the other marker</i><br>
            Do 1 decrease row, then 4 stockinette rows, 
            repeat until I reach the waist then do increases (I’ll figure this out later!!)<br>
            I don’t know what I’m doing but it seems to be working so yay <br>
            I really like this yarn. it's a bit splitty but the price is low so I can't complain
        </p>

            I just ordered the last 2 available skeins of Lipstick from the KnitPicks website. 
            I'm hoping that's enough to cover the sleeves, but I'm not sure.

            Decreases done!!!! Took 49 rounds from the bust apex<br>
            Found <a href="https://kateoates.shop/blog/2023/2/7/waist-shaping-that-works">another great tutorial</a> for waist shaping!
            Going to follow her hip shaping/increase plan: <br>
            <i>Side Hip Shaping Round (even underarm sts): [Work in pat to 1 st before marker, M1R, k1, sm, k1, M1L] twice—4 sts increased.</i>
