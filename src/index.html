Hello! Feel free to reference my code and ask me questions through my guestbook. 
However, please don’t copy my entire layout (not that I’m particularly good at this anyway - 
you're probably better off learning from someone else!)

        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my home on the web!</p>
        <p>
            I built this website to document everything I love. 
            I've come to realize, in these past few years, how 
            detrimental social media is to my mental health
             - and how making my own website, having control 
            over every tiny detail of how it's presented 
            (and how I'm represented by extension), is actually a perfect 
            solution to all of my problems, including my irrational 
            need for documentation and organization across many parts 
            of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I made this site for me, and me only! But I do hope you 
            have a good time here. Please feel free to reach out and 
            write in my <a href="contact.html">guestbook</a>!
        </p>
