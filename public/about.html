I am a PhD student and budding researcher with interests spanning computation, complex systems, and evolutionary biology.</p><p>That's how I typically introduce myself to people these days. It sounds really cool, but this site isn't about my research. This website is a place to collect photos, notes, projects, and various ramblings and happenings from my <b>personal life</b>. As much as I love my current line of work, this site is my refuge from the "real" world; a way to live out my childhood dream of being a webmaster, and a space to celebrate the parts of myself that don't always get as much attention anymore.</p><p>Outside of academia, I am a formally trained <a href="art.html"><b>artist</b></a> and a less formally competent ballet school graduate (I wouldn't call myself an actual ballet dancer). I also underwent classical piano training for over a decade during my "youth" (2006-2017), but I haven't played seriously in years. More recently, I picked up <a href="knit.html"><b>knitting</b></a> in October 2025, which has quickly become one of my current hyperfixations.</p><p>If you care about personality typologies, I am an <b>INFP-T</b>. Astrologically, my tropical big three are <b>Gemini rising</b>, <b>Scorpio sun</b>, and <b>Scorpio moon</b>. My sidereal big three are <b>Taurus rising</b>, <b>Libra sun</b>, and <b>Scorpio moon</b>. My Vedic nakshatras are <b>Rohini rising</b>, <b>Vishakha sun</b>, and <b>Anuradha moon</b>.</p><p>Anyway, thank you so much for being here, and welcome! I hope you enjoy your stay.</p><p><i>Last updated on December 21, 2025.</i></p></div><div id="footer">© 2025 an unhatched egg</div></body></html>
