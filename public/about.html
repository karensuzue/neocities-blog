I am a PhD student and budding researcher with interests spanning computation, complex systems, and evolutionary biology.</p><p>That's how I typically introduce myself to people these days. It sounds really cool, but this site isn't about my research. This website is a place to collect photos, notes, projects, and various ramblings and happenings from my <b>personal life</b>. As much as I love my current line of work, this site is my refuge from the "real" world; a way to live out my childhood dream of being a webmaster, and a space to celebrate the parts of myself that don't always get as much attention anymore.</p><p>Outside of academia, I am a formally trained <a href="art.html"><b>artist</b></a> and a less formally competent ballet school graduate (I attended the Ho Chi Minh City Intermediate Dance School for 6 years, though I wouldn't call myself an actual ballet dancer). I also underwent classical piano training for over a decade, from 2006-2017, but I haven't played seriously in years. More recently, I picked up <a href="knit.html"><b>knitting</b></a> in October 2025, which has quickly become one of my current hyperfixations.</p><p>If you care about personality typologies, I am an <b>INFP-T</b>. For my astrology-inclined friends, my tropical big three are <b>Gemini rising</b>, <b>Scorpio sun</b>, and <b>Scorpio moon</b>. My sidereal big three are <b>Taurus rising</b>, <b>Libra sun</b>, and <b>Scorpio moon</b>. My Vedic nakshatras are <b>Rohini rising</b>, <b>Vishakha sun</b>, and <b>Anuradha moon</b>.</p><p>Anyway, thank you so much for being here, and welcome! I hope you enjoy your stay.</p><table width="100%" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr valign="top"><td width="50%"><h3>Links</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/people/azurenukes">Ravelry</a> - a second home for my knitting projects</li><li><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/azurenukes">StoryGraph</a> - what I've read, what I want to read, and what I'm currently reading</li></ul></td></tr></table><p style="font-size:13px">Last modified: <span id="last-modified"></span></p><script>const d=new Date(document.lastModified);document.getElementById("last-modified").textContent=d.toLocaleDateString(void 0,{year:"numeric",month:"long",day:"numeric",hour:"2-digit",minute:"2-digit"})</script><div id="footer"><img src="assets/div.png"> © 2025 an unhatched egg</div></div></body></html>
