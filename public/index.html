Over the past few years, I’ve come to realize how detrimental social media has been to my mental health, and how creating my own website is actually the perfect solution to many of my problems.</p><p>I’ve always wanted a centralized, intentional space to capture different parts of my life. I’m a huge data hoarder—<i>ahem</i>, archivist— and this site serves as an outlet for sorting through the clutter in my filesystem (and my brain) and turning it into something meaningful.</p><p>I also disliked how social media stifled my self-expression. Here, I have full control over every detail of how my site is presented (and, by extension, how I’m represented). I get to post whatever I want. I get to enjoy things that may not be trendy or considered “cool,” without worrying about anyone scrutinizing them. Chances are, if you have access to this site, you’re a friend.</p><p><b>I made this site for me, and me only!</b> But I do hope you enjoy your time here.
