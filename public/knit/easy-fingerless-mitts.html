From it, I learned how to knit, purl, do a long-tail cast on, a regular bind off, seaming, frogging, and how to put dropped stitches back on the needle.</p><p><b>November 6, 2025</b><br>Finished my first glove using English style/throw knitting.</p><p><b>November 12, 2025</b><br>Working on my second glove using Continental style. I was looking for ways to speed things up so I moved from throwing to flicking, but that was too hard. Continental ended up being really intuitive for me.<br>My stitches on the second glove aren't as tight as the first - I don't know if that's a good thing. But being able to knit faster is awesome.</p><p><b>November 16, 2025</b><br>Done!! Gave this to a friend!! She loves it :^)<br>The second glove is slightly shorter than the first but I didn't notice until everything's done and wrapped up - oh well!</p></div><div id="footer">© 2025 an unhatched egg</div></body></html>
